=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Community - Community-inspired Perl::Critic policies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ perlcritic --theme community script.pl
  $ perlcritic --theme community lib/
  
  # .perlcriticrc
  theme = community
  severity = 1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of L<Perl::Critic> policies to enforce the practices generally
recommended by subsets of the Perl community, particularly on
L<IRC|perlcommunity/IRC>. Formerly known as L<Perl::Critic::Freenode>. Because
this policy "theme" is designed to be used with zero configuration on the
command line, some duplication will occur if it is used in combination with
core L<Perl::Critic> policies.

=head1 AFFILIATION

This module has no functionality, but instead contains documentation for this
distribution and acts as a means of pulling other modules into a bundle. All of
the Policy modules contained herein will have an "AFFILIATION" section
announcing their participation in this grouping.
