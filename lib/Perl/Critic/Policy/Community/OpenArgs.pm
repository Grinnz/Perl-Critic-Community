=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::OpenArgs - Always use the three-argument form
of open

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<open()> function may be called in a two-argument form where the filename
is parsed to determine the mode of opening, which may include piping input or
output. (In the one-argument form, this filename is retrieved from a global
variable, but the same magic is used.) This can lead to vulnerabilities if the
filename is retrieved from user input or could begin or end with a special
character. The three-argument form specifies the open mode as the second
argument, so it is always distinct from the filename.

  open FILE;                   # not ok
  open my $fh, "<$filename";   # not ok
  open my $fh, '<', $filename; # ok

This policy is similar to the core policy
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::ProhibitTwoArgOpen>, but additionally
prohibits one-argument opens.

=head1 AFFILIATION
