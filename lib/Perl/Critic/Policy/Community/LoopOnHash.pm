=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::LoopOnHash - Don't loop over hashes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It's possible to loop over a hash as if it was a list, which results in
alternating between the keys and values of the hash. Often, the intent was
instead to loop over either the keys or the values of the hash.

 foreach my $foo (%hash) { ... }      # not ok
 action() for %hash;                  # not ok
 foreach my $foo (keys %hash) { ... } # ok
 action() for values %hash;           # ok

If you intended to loop over alternating keys and values, you can make this
intent clear by first copying them to an array:

 foreach my $key_or_value (@{[%hash]}) { ... }
 foreach my $key_or_value (my @dummy = %hash) { ... }

This policy is a subclass of the policy
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitLoopOnHash>, and performs the same
function but in the C<community> theme.
