=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::ConditionalDeclarations - Don't declare
variables conditionally

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It is possible to add a postfix condition to a variable declaration, like
C<my $foo = $bar if $baz>. However, it is unclear (and undefined) if the
variable will be declared when the condition is not met. Instead, declare the
variable and then assign to it conditionally, or use the
L<ternary operator|perlop/"Conditional Operator"> to assign a value
conditionally.

  my $foo = $bar if $baz;           # not ok
  my ($foo, $bar) = @_ unless $baz; # not ok
  our $bar = $_ for 0..10;          # not ok
  my $foo; $foo = $bar if $baz;     # ok
  my $foo = $baz ? $bar : undef;    # ok

This policy is a subclass of the core policy
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitConditionalDeclarations>, and
performs the same function but in the C<community> theme.

=head1 AFFILIATION
