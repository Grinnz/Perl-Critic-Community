=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::Threads - Interpreter-based threads are
officially discouraged

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl interpreter L<threads> are officially discouraged. They were created to
emulate C<fork()> in Windows environments, and are not fast or lightweight as
one may expect. Non-blocking code or I/O can be easily parallelized by using an
event loop such as L<POE>, L<IO::Async>, or L<Mojo::IOLoop>. Blocking code is
usually better parallelized by forking, which on Unix-like systems is fast and
efficient. Modules such as L<forks> and L<Parallel::Prefork> can make forking
easier to work with, as well as forking modules for event loops such as
L<POE::Wheel::Run>, L<IO::Async::Process>, or L<Mojo::IOLoop/"subprocess">.

=head1 AFFILIATION

This policy is part of L<Perl::Critic::Community>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION
