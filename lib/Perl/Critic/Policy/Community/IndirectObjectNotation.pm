=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::IndirectObjectNotation - Don't call methods
indirectly

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl allows a form of method call where the method name is first, followed by
the invocant (class or object to call the method on), then the argument list.
This is an unfortunate legacy syntax that should no longer be used. See
L<perlobj/"Indirect Object Syntax"> and L<indirect/"REFERENCES"> for more
information.

 my $obj = new My::Class @args;   # not ok
 my $obj = My::Class->new(@args); # ok

It is difficult to detect indirect object notation by static analysis, so this
policy only forbids the C<new> method call by default, as it is highly unlikely
to be the name of a standard subroutine call. Consider using the L<indirect>
pragma to cause the code to warn or die when indirect object notation is used.

On Perl 5.32 or newer (or automatically with C<use v5.36> or newer),
L<feature/"The 'indirect' feature"> can be disabled to prevent the parser from
interpreting syntax as indirect object notation.

This policy is a subclass of the L<Perl::Critic> core policy
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Objects::ProhibitIndirectSyntax>, and performs the same
function but in the C<community> theme.

=head1 AFFILIATION

This policy is part of L<Perl::Critic::Community>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This policy can be configured, in the same way as its parent policy
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Objects::ProhibitIndirectSyntax>, to attempt to forbid
additional method names from being called indirectly. Be aware this may lead to
false positives as it is difficult to detect indirect object notation by static
analysis. The C<new> subroutine is always forbidden in addition to these.
