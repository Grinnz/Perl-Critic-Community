=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::AmpersandSubCalls - Don't use & to call
subroutines

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ampersands (C<&>) were once needed to call subroutines, but in modern Perl they
are not only unnecessary but actually change the behavior from what you may
expect. Calling a subroutine with an ampersand ignores the subroutine's
prototype if any, which may change what arguments the subroutine receives.
Additionally, calling a subroutine as C<&foo;> with no arguments will pass on
the contents of C<@_> from the current subroutine, which may be quite
surprising. Unless used intentionally for this behavior, the ampersand should
simply be omitted.

  my $value = &foo();  # not ok
  my $sum = &foo(1,2); # not ok
  my $value = foo();   # ok
  my $sum = foo 1,2;   # ok

This policy is a subclass of the core policy
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProhibitAmpersandSigils>, and performs the
same function but in the C<community> theme.

=head1 AFFILIATION
