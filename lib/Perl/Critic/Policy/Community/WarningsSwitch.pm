=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::WarningsSwitch - Scripts should not use the -w
switch on the shebang line

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<-w> switch enables warnings globally in a perl program, including for any
modules that did not explicitly enable or disable any warnings. The C<-W>
switch enables warnings even for modules that explicitly disabled them. The
primary issue with this is enabling warnings for code that you did not write.
Some of these modules may not be designed to run with warnings enabled, but
still work fine. Instead, use L<warnings> within your own code only.

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w # not ok
  #!/usr/bin/perl -W # not ok
  use warnings;      # ok
