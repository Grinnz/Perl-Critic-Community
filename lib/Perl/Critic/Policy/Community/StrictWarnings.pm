=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::StrictWarnings - Always use strict and
warnings, or a module that imports these

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<strict> and L<warnings> pragmas help avoid many common pitfalls such as
misspellings, scoping issues, and performing operations on undefined values.
Warnings can also alert you to deprecated or experimental functionality. The
pragmas may either be explicitly imported with C<use>, or indirectly through a
number of importer modules such as L<Moose> or L<strictures>. L<strict> is also
enabled automatically with a C<use> declaration of perl version 5.12 or higher,
as is L<warnings> with a C<use> declaration of 5.36 or higher.

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use Moose;

  use 5.012;
  use warnings;

  use 5.036;

This policy is similar to the core policies
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict> and
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings>, but combines
them into one policy in the C<community> theme. The default modules recognized
as importing L<strict> and L<warnings> are defined by the same constants as the
core policies, L<Perl::Critic::Utils::Constants/"@STRICT_EQUIVALENT_MODULES">.
To define additional modules, see L</"CONFIGURATION">.

=head1 AFFILIATION

This policy is part of L<Perl::Critic::Community>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This policy can be configured to recognize additional modules as importers of
L<strict> and L<warnings>, by putting an entry in a C<.perlcriticrc> file like
this:

  [Community::StrictWarnings]
  extra_importers = MyApp::Class MyApp::Role
