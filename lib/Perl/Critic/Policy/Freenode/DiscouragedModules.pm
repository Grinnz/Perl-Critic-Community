=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Freenode::DiscouragedModules - Various modules
discouraged from use

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Various modules are discouraged by the denizens of #perl on Freenode IRC, for
various reasons which may include: buggy behavior, cruft, maintainer issues,
or simply better modern replacements.

=head1 MODULES

=head2 AnyEvent

L<AnyEvent>'s author refuses to use public bugtracking and actively breaks
interoperability. See L<POE>, L<IO::Async>, and L<Mojo::IOLoop> for sane and
interoperable async event loops.

=head2 Any::Moose

L<Any::Moose> is deprecated. Use L<Moo> instead.

=head2 CGI

L<CGI>.pm is an ancient module for communicating via the CGI protocol, with
tons of bad practices and cruft. Use a modern framework such as those based on
L<Plack> (L<Web::Simple>, L<Dancer2>, L<Catalyst>) or L<Mojolicious>, they can
still be served via CGI if you choose.

=head2 Coro

L<Coro> no longer works on perl 5.22, you need to use the author's forked
version of Perl. Avoid at all costs.

=head2 File::Slurp

L<File::Slurp> gets file encodings all wrong, line endings on win32 are messed
up, and it was written before layers were properly added. Use
L<File::Slurp::Tiny>, L<File::Slurper>, L<Path::Tiny/"slurp">,
L<Data::Munge/"slurp">, or L<Mojo::Util/"slurp">.

=head2 HTML::Template

L<HTML::Template> is an old and buggy module, try L<Template::Toolkit> or
L<HTML::Zoom> instead, or L<HTML::Template::Pro> if you must use the same
syntax.

=head2 JSON

L<JSON>.pm is old and full of slow logic. Use L<JSON::MaybeXS> instead, it is a
drop-in replacement in most cases.

=head2 JSON::Any

L<JSON::Any> is deprecated. Use L<JSON::MaybeXS> instead.

=head2 JSON::XS

L<JSON::XS>'s author refuses to use public bugtracking and actively breaks
interoperability. L<Cpanel::JSON::XS> is a fork with several bugfixes and a
more collaborative maintainer. See also L<JSON::MaybeXS>.

=head2 List::MoreUtils

L<List::MoreUtils> is a far more complex distribution than it needs to be. See
L<List::Util> or L<List::UtilsBy> for better options.

=head2 Mouse

L<Mouse> was created to be a faster version of L<Moose>, a niche that has since
been better filled by L<Moo>. Use L<Moo> instead.

=head2 Net::IRC

L<Net::IRC> is an ancient module implementing the IRC protocol. Use a modern
event-loop-based module instead. Choices are L<POE::Component::IRC> (used for
L<Bot::BasicBot>), L<Net::Async::IRC>, and L<Mojo::IRC>.

=head2 XML::Simple

L<XML::Simple> tries to coerce complex XML documents into perl data structures.
This leads to overcomplicated structures and unexpected behavior. Use a proper
DOM parser instead like L<XML::LibXML>, L<XML::TreeBuilder>, L<XML::Twig>, or
L<Mojo::DOM>.

=head1 AFFILIATION

This policy is part of L<Perl::Critic::Freenode>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This policy is not configurable except for the standard options.
